# rag_csv_local_llm
This is to analyze your CSV data with RAG application using local LLM (Mixtral)

* First install the ollama in your local machine.
  * Ex: link to install ollama in local mac machine (https://ollama.com/download/mac)
* Start the ollama services using below command from your terminal window ...
    * ollama serve
      * If service already running then you will see below message
          * Error: listen tcp 127.0.0.1:11434: bind: address already in use
* Now Pull the required, open source LLM Model
    * EX: ollama run mixtral ( First time it will take some time to down load the LLM package)
* Run below command to start the APP, which will open the app in your browser
    * streamlit run stremlite.py
 

Below is the output of my sample CSV analysis:
